# NoteOfTheEveryting
This project is developed using Django with my teammate for graduation at Işık University.
This project is a note sharing website where users can upload their notes in any format, comment on notes shared by other users, and rate them. The shared notes are published on the website after passing the Admin approval. Users can easily access the notes they want with the filtering and search feature. 
There is a chatbot integrated into the website and users can get a quick response to their questions in this way.
